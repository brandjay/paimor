                     <bold>Website Maintenance:</bold>
                      After the initial website setup, I do not provide ongoing maintenance. This includes updates, content changes, or troubleshooting. For continuous support, consider hiring a dedicated web developer or a maintenance service.
                      Security and Payments:
                      Security is paramount when handling payments on your website. Here’s why:
                      Payment Gateways: Ensure secure payment gateways (such as SSL encryption) to protect sensitive information.
                      User Authentication: Implement robust user authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
                      Regular Audits: Regularly audit your website for vulnerabilities and apply security patches promptly.
                      Client Responsibility: Clients interacting with your website will directly handle payments. Stress the importance of secure practices, such as strong passwords and safe browsing habits.
